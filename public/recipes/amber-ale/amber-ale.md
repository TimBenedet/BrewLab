# Classic Amber Ale - Recipe Steps

## 🌾 Mashing
1.  **Prepare Mash Tun**: Preheat your mash tun by adding hot water and letting it sit for a few minutes. Discard water.
2.  **Strike Water**: Heat 15.73 liters of water to 73°C (163.4°F).
3.  **Mash In**: Add grains to the strike water. Stir well to avoid dough balls. Target mash temperature: 67°C (152.6°F).
4.  **Rest**: Hold mash at 67°C (152.6°F) for 60 minutes.
5.  **Mash Out (Optional)**: Raise temperature to 76°C (168.8°F) for 10 minutes. This can help with lautering.

## 🔥 Boil (60 minutes total)
1.  **Collect Wort**: Sparge grains with approximately 12.5 liters of water at 76°C (168.8°F), or until you collect about 23 liters of wort.
2.  **Bring to Boil**: Bring the wort to a rolling boil.
3.  **60 min - Bittering Hops**: Add 20g of Magnum hops.
4.  **15 min - Flavor Hops**: Add 25g of Cascade hops.
5.  **10 min - Whirlfloc/Irish Moss**: Add 1 Whirlfloc tablet or 1 tsp Irish Moss (optional, for clarity).
6.  **0 min/Flameout - Aroma Hops**: Add 25g of Amarillo hops. Start whirlpool if desired.

## 🌪️ Whirlpool (Optional)
1.  **Cool to 80-85°C (176-185°F)**: If you added flameout hops and want a whirlpool, cool the wort slightly.
2.  **Whirlpool**: Stir the wort gently for 15-20 minutes. This helps settle trub and enhances hop aroma.

## 🥶 Cooling
1.  **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to yeast pitching temperature (around 18-20°C or 64-68°F for ale yeast). Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or an ice bath.

## 🧪 Fermentation
1.  **Sanitize**: Ensure your fermenter and any equipment touching the cooled wort is thoroughly sanitized.
2.  **Transfer Wort**: Transfer the cooled wort to the fermenter, avoiding excessive splashing (after initial aeration if done pre-transfer).
3.  **Aerate Wort**: Aerate the wort well by shaking the fermenter or using an oxygenation stone.
4.  **Pitch Yeast**: Add 1 sachet of SafAle US-05 yeast.
5.  **Ferment**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-14 days, or until final gravity is stable.

## 🌱 Dry Hopping (Optional, if desired for more aroma)
1.  **After Primary Fermentation**: Once active fermentation subsides (typically 5-7 days), add 30g of Cascade hops directly to the fermenter.
2.  **Duration**: Let dry hops sit for 3-5 days.

---

## 🍾 Bottling/Kegging
1.  **Check Final Gravity**: Ensure fermentation is complete by taking gravity readings a few days apart.
2.  **Prime (if bottling)**: If bottling, prepare a priming sugar solution (e.g., ~100g dextrose for 19L batch, dissolved in boiled water). Gently mix into the beer.
3.  **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer beer to sanitized bottles or keg.
4.  **Condition**:
    *   Bottles: Store at room temperature for 2-3 weeks for carbonation.
    *   Keg: Force carbonate as per your setup.
5.  **Chill & Enjoy**: Once carbonated/conditioned, chill and enjoy your Classic Amber Ale! 🍻

Happy Brewing!
