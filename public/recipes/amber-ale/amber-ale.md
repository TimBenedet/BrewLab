## 🌾 Mashing

*   **Prepare Mash Tun**: Preheat your mash tun by adding hot water (around 75°C / 167°F) and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes. Discard this water.
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 15 liters of brewing water to 73°C (163°F).
*   **Mash In**: Slowly add your crushed grains to the strike water, stirring continuously to avoid dough balls. The target mash temperature is 67°C (152°F). Adjust with hot/cold water if necessary.
*   **Saccharification Rest**: Hold the mash at 67°C (152°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out (Optional)**: Raise the mash temperature to 76°C (168°F) and hold for 10 minutes. This can improve lauterability and wort clarity.
*   **Lauter & Sparge**: Recirculate the wort until it runs clear. Then, begin lautering (draining the wort). Sparge with approximately 12-14 liters of water at 76°C (168°F) to collect about 23-24 liters of wort for the boil.

## 🔥 Boil (60 minutes total)

*   **Bring to Boil**: Bring the collected wort to a vigorous, rolling boil. Watch for boil-overs.
*   **60 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 25g of Magnum hops (Bittering).
*   **15 min**: Add 15g of Cascade hops (Flavor/Aroma) and 1 Whirlfloc tablet (or 1 tsp Irish Moss) for clarity.
*   **5 min**: Add 15g of Centennial hops (Aroma).

## 🌪️ Whirlpool/Aroma Additions

*   **Flameout**: Turn off the heat.
*   **Whirlpool Hops**: Add 30g of Amarillo hops.
*   **Whirlpool**: Stir the wort gently to create a whirlpool for 10-15 minutes. Let it settle for another 10-15 minutes. This helps consolidate trub and extract aroma.

---
## 🥶 Cooling

*   **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to your yeast's preferred pitching temperature (typically 18-20°C or 64-68°F for American ale yeast). Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or an ice bath. Proper sanitation is crucial from this point forward.

## 🧪 Fermentation

*   **Sanitize**: Ensure your fermenter, airlock, and any equipment that will touch the cooled wort are thoroughly sanitized.
*   **Transfer Wort**: Carefully transfer the cooled, aerated wort to the sanitized fermenter, leaving most ofhe trub behind.
*   **Aerate (if not done pre-transfer)**: If you haven't aerated the wort yet (e.g., during transfer), do so now by shaking the fermenter or using an oxygenation stone and pure O2.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Rehydrate dry yeast as per manufacturer's instructions, or directly pitch your chosen yeast (e.g., 1 sachet of SafAle US-05 or a liquid equivalent).
*   **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at a stable temperature of 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until fermentation activity (bubbling in airlock) significantly slows and gravity readings are stable for 2-3 days.

## 🍾 Bottling/Kegging

*   **Check Final Gravity (FG)**: Confirm fermentation is complete by taking hydrometer readings. They should be stable and within the expected range for the recipe.
*   **Cold Crash (Optional)**: To improve clarity, you can cold crash the beer by lowering its temperature to near freezing (0-4°C / 32-39°F) for 24-48 hours.
*   **Priming (for bottling)**: If bottling, prepare a priming sugar solution (e.g., ~100-120g of dextrose for a 19-20L batch, dissolved in a small amount of boiled water and cooled). Gently mix this solution into the beer in a bottling bucket.
*   **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer the beer to sanitized bottles or a sanitized keg, minimizing oxygen exposure.
*   **Condition**:
    *   **Bottles**: Store at room temperature (around 20°C / 68°F) for 2-3 weeks for carbonation.
    *   **Keg**: Force carbonate according to your kegging system's instructions.
*   **Chill & Enjoy**: Once carbonated and conditioned, chill your Amber Ale thoroughly and enjoy! 🍻

Happy Brewing!
