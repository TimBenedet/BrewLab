## Brewer's Notes
This Classic Amber Ale strikes a balance between malt sweetness and hop bitterness, with a beautiful amber hue. It's a crowd-pleaser and a great all-around beer.

## Mashing
*   **Prepare Mash Tun**: Preheat your mash tun by adding hot water (around 75-80°C or 167-176°F) and letting it sit for a few minutes. Discard water. This helps maintain mash temperature.
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 15.73 liters (4.15 gal) of water to 73°C (163.4°F).
*   **Mash In**: Add your milled grains to the strike water. Stir thoroughly to ensure there are no dough balls and the temperature is consistent. Target mash temperature is 67°C (152.6°F).
*   **Rest**: Hold the mash at 67°C (152.6°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out (Optional)**: After the 60-minute rest, you can raise the temperature to 76°C (168.8°F) for 10 minutes. This stops enzymatic activity and can help with lautering.

## Boil
*   **Collect Wort**: Lauter and sparge the grains with approximately 12.5 liters (3.3 gal) of water heated to 76°C (168.8°F), or until you collect your target pre-boil volume (around 23 liters or 6 gal for a 19L batch).
*   **Bring to Boil**: Bring the collected wort to a vigorous, rolling boil. Be mindful of boilovers, especially when the hot break occurs. Total boil time is 60 minutes.
*   **60 min (Start of Boil)** - Bittering Hops: Add 20g of Magnum hops.
*   **15 min (Remaining)** - Flavor Hops: Add 25g of Cascade hops.
*   **10 min (Remaining)** - Finings: Add 1 Whirlfloc tablet or 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss (optional, for improved clarity).
*   **0 min (Flameout)** - Aroma Hops: Add 25g of Amarillo hops.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
*   **Cool Slightly (Optional for Whirlpool Hops)**: If you added flameout hops and want to perform a whirlpool, allow the wort to cool slightly to around 80-85°C (176-185°F) to preserve volatile hop aromas.
*   **Whirlpool**: Create a gentle whirlpool in your kettle for 15-20 minutes. This helps collect trub in the center and can improve hop aroma extraction from flameout/whirlpool additions.

## Cooling
*   **Cool Wort Rapidly**: After the boil (and whirlpool, if performed), cool the wort as quickly as possible to your yeast pitching temperature (typically 18-20°C or 64-68°F for ale yeasts). Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or an ice bath in your sink. Rapid cooling minimizes the risk of contamination.

## Fermentation
*   **Sanitize Equipment**: Ensure your fermenter, airlock, and any equipment that will touch the cooled wort (e.g., auto-siphon, hoses) is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
*   **Transfer Wort**: Carefully transfer the cooled wort to the sanitized fermenter, trying to leave as much trub behind in the kettle as possible.
*   **Aerate Wort**: Aerate the wort thoroughly. This can be done by vigorously shaking the fermenter for several minutes (if it's sealed), or by using an aeration stone with an oxygen tank or sanitized air pump. Yeast needs oxygen for healthy initial growth.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Add 1 sachet of SafAle US-05 yeast (or your chosen yeast strain). Rehydrate dry yeast according to package instructions, or sprinkle directly onto the wort if the manufacturer allows.
*   **Ferment**: Place the fermenter in a temperature-controlled environment (if possible) and ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for approximately 7-14 days, or until the final gravity (FG) is stable for a few days in a row.

## Bottling/Kegging
*   **Confirm Fermentation is Complete**: Take gravity readings a few days apart. If the reading is stable, fermentation is likely complete.
*   **Prime (if bottling)**: If you're bottling, prepare a priming sugar solution. For a 19-liter (5-gallon) batch, this is typically around 80-100g of dextrose (corn sugar) dissolved in about 2 cups of boiled and cooled water. Gently mix this solution into the beer in a bottling bucket, avoiding splashing.
*   **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer the beer to sanitized bottles or a sanitized keg.
*   **Condition**:
    *   **Bottles**: Store the bottles at room temperature (around 18-22°C or 64-72°F) for 2-3 weeks to allow for carbonation.
    *   **Keg**: If kegging, you can force carbonate according to your kegerator setup and desired carbonation level.
*   **Chill & Enjoy**: Once carbonated and conditioned, chill your Classic Amber Ale to serving temperature and enjoy your homebrewed beer! 🍻
