# Amber Ale - Brewing Steps 🍻

## I. Preparation & Mash 🌾

1.  **Heat Strike Water**: Heat 15 liters of water to 72°C (162°F).
2.  **Mash In**: Add crushed grains to the hot water. Stir well to avoid dough balls. Target mash temperature is 67°C (153°F).
3.  **Mash Rest**: Hold mash temperature at 67°C (153°F) for 60 minutes.
4.  **Mash Out**: Raise temperature to 76°C (169°F) and hold for 10 minutes.
5.  **Sparge**: Slowly rinse grains with 12 liters of 76°C (169°F) water, collecting the wort.

## II. Boil & Hop Additions 🌿⏱️

1.  **Bring to Boil**: Bring the collected wort to a rolling boil. Total boil time: 60 minutes.
2.  **First Wort Hops (Optional)**: If using, add First Wort Hops as the wort heats.
3.  **60 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 20g of Challenger hops.
4.  **15 min (Remaining)**: Add 15g of East Kent Goldings hops and 1 tsp of Irish Moss (or other kettle finings).
5.  **0 min (Flameout)**: Add 15g of East Kent Goldings hops for aroma.

## III. Cooling & Transfer ❄️➡️

1.  **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to 20°C (68°F). An immersion chiller or ice bath can be used.
2.  **Transfer to Fermenter**: Carefully transfer the cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter, leaving trub behind.
3.  **Aerate Wort**: Aerate the wort well (e.g., by shaking the fermenter or using an aeration stone) to provide oxygen for the yeast.

## IV. Fermentation & Conditioning 酵母✨

1.  **Pitch Yeast**: Add your chosen ale yeast.
2.  **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until fermentation activity subsides and gravity readings are stable.
3.  **Secondary Fermentation (Optional)**: Transfer to a secondary fermenter for 5-7 days for clarity.
4.  **Cold Crash (Optional)**: Chill to 0-4°C (32-39°F) for 24-48 hours to help yeast and proteins settle.

## V. Bottling / Kegging & Carbonation 🍾📦

1.  **Prepare for Packaging**: Sanitize bottles or keg.
2.  **Priming (if bottling)**: If bottling, prepare a priming sugar solution (e.g., 100g corn sugar in 200ml boiled water for a 20L batch). Gently mix into the beer.
3.  **Package**: Fill bottles or keg.
4.  **Carbonate**:
    *   Bottles: Store at room temperature for 2-3 weeks for carbonation.
    *   Keg: Force carbonate according to your kegging system.
5.  **Condition**: Allow the beer to condition for at least 1-2 weeks (longer for higher gravity beers).

## VI. Enjoy! 🎉

Chill to your preferred serving temperature and enjoy your homemade Classic Amber Ale!
