# Classic Amber Ale - Brewing Steps

## Mash Steps

1.  **Mash In**:
    *   Target Temperature: 66°C (151°F)
    *   Duration: 60 minutes
    *   Add 12.50 liters of water at 72.0°C to your grains.
    *   Stir well to ensure no dough balls. Maintain temperature for 60 minutes.

2.  **Mash Out (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   Target Temperature: 76°C (169°F)
    *   Duration: 10 minutes
    *   Raise mash temperature to 76°C. This stops enzymatic activity and helps with lautering.

## Lautering and Sparging

1.  **Recirculate (Vorlauf)**:
    *   Slowly draw off wort from the mash tun and gently return it to the top of the grain bed until the wort runs clear. This usually takes 10-15 minutes.
2.  **Sparge**:
    *   Sparge with approximately 15-17 liters of water at 76°C (169°F). The exact amount will depend on your system and pre-boil volume target.
    *   Collect wort until you reach your target pre-boil volume (around 25 liters for this recipe).

## Boil

*   **Total Boil Time**: 60 minutes

1.  Bring wort to a rolling boil.
2.  **60 min (Start of Boil)**:
    *   Add 28g Cascade hops.
3.  **15 min remaining**:
    *   Add 14g Centennial hops.
    *   Add 1 tsp Irish Moss (or other kettle finings).
4.  **5 min remaining**:
    *   Add 14g Amarillo hops.
    *   If using an immersion chiller, add it now to sanitize.

## Whirlpool (Optional) / Cooling

1.  **End of Boil**: Turn off heat.
2.  **Whirlpool (Optional)**:
    *   If you have aroma hops for whirlpool, add them now.
    *   Stir the wort vigorously to create a whirlpool, then let it settle for 15-20 minutes. This helps collect trub in the center of the kettle.
3.  **Cool Wort**:
    *   Cool the wort rapidly to your yeast's pitching temperature (around 18-20°C or 64-68°F for US-05).

## Fermentation

1.  **Transfer to Fermenter**:
    *   Carefully transfer the cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter, leaving behind as much trub as possible.
2.  **Aerate Wort**:
    *   Aerate the wort thoroughly. Shaking the fermenter, using an aeration stone with an air pump, or an oxygen wand are common methods.
3.  **Pitch Yeast**:
    *   Pitch one packet of rehydrated Safale US-05 yeast (or make a starter if using liquid yeast).
4.  **Ferment**:
    *   Ferment at a consistent temperature, ideally around 18-20°C (64-68°F) for US-05, for 7-14 days, or until fermentation activity subsides and final gravity is stable.

## Packaging

1.  **Check Final Gravity**: Ensure fermentation is complete by taking gravity readings a few days apart. Target FG is around 1.012.
2.  **Cold Crash (Optional)**:
    *   Chill the beer to near freezing temperatures for 24-48 hours to help yeast and other particulates settle out for a clearer beer.
3.  **Package**:
    *   Transfer the beer to a bottling bucket or keg.
    *   If bottling, prime with sugar (e.g., approx. 80-100g corn sugar for a 19L batch to achieve ~2.4 vol CO2).
    *   If kegging, force carbonate to desired level.
4.  **Condition**:
    *   Allow the beer to carbonate and condition for 1-2 weeks (bottles) or a few days (keg) before enjoying.

Cheers!
