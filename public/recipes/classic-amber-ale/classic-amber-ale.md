# Classic Amber Ale - Recipe Steps

## I. Preparation

1.  **Clean and Sanitize**: Ensure all your brewing equipment (mash tun, kettle, fermenter, spoons, etc.) is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
2.  **Mill Grains**: Mill your Pale Malt, Crystal Malt, and Victory Malt. Aim for a consistent crush that leaves the husks largely intact but breaks open the kernels.
3.  **Heat Strike Water**: Heat approximately 12-13 liters of strike water to about 73-75°C. The target is to achieve a mash temperature of 67°C once mixed with the grains. (Adjust strike water temperature based on your equipment and grain temperature).

## II. Mashing

1.  **Mash In**:
    *   Add the milled grains to your mash tun.
    *   Slowly add the strike water to the grains, stirring well to avoid dough balls and ensure even temperature distribution.
    *   Target mash temperature: **67°C (153°F)**.
    *   Hold this temperature for **60 minutes** for saccharification.
2.  **Mash Out**:
    *   After 60 minutes, begin to raise the temperature of the mash to **76°C (169°F)**. This can be done by direct heat (if your system allows) or by adding boiling water carefully.
    *   Hold at 76°C for **10 minutes**. This stops enzymatic activity and makes the wort less viscous for lautering.

## III. Lautering and Sparging

1.  **Recirculate (Vorlauf)**:
    *   Slowly draw off a few liters of wort from the bottom of the mash tun and gently pour it back over the top of the grain bed.
    *   Continue this process until the wort runs clear. This helps set the grain bed as a filter.
2.  **Sparge**:
    *   Once the wort is clear, begin to transfer it to your boil kettle.
    *   Simultaneously, start sparging by gently sprinkling hot water (around 76-78°C or 169-172°F) over the top of the grain bed.
    *   Aim to collect approximately **25 liters** of wort in your boil kettle. Monitor the specific gravity of the runnings; stop sparging if it drops too low (e.g., below 1.008-1.010) to avoid extracting tannins.

## IV. Boil

1.  **Bring to a Boil**: Heat the collected wort in the kettle. Once it reaches a rolling boil, start your 60-minute timer.
2.  **Hop Additions**:
    *   **@ 60 minutes** (start of boil): Add **20g Cascade** hops.
    *   **@ 15 minutes** remaining: Add **15g Centennial** hops and **1 tsp Irish Moss** (or 1 tablet).
    *   **@ 5 minutes** remaining: Add **15g Cascade** hops (for aroma).
3.  **Monitor Boil**: Ensure a good rolling boil throughout the 60 minutes. Watch out for boilovers, especially after hop additions.

## V. Cooling and Transfer

1.  **Cool Wort**: After the 60-minute boil, rapidly cool the wort to your yeast pitching temperature (ideally around 18-20°C or 64-68°F for US-05). Use an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, or an ice bath.
2.  **Transfer to Fermenter**: Once cooled, carefully transfer the wort to your sanitized fermenter, leaving behind as much trub (hop debris and hot break) as possible.
3.  **Aerate Wort**: Aerate the wort thoroughly. This can be done by splashing during transfer (if careful about sanitation), using an aeration stone with an aquarium pump, or by shaking the fermenter vigorously (if it's not too full). Oxygen is crucial for healthy yeast activity.

## VI. Fermentation

1.  **Pitch Yeast**:
    *   Rehydrate dry yeast (SafAle US-05) according to package instructions, or sprinkle directly onto the surface of the aerated wort.
    *   If using liquid yeast, ensure it's at the correct temperature and pitch the appropriate amount (a starter might be recommended).
2.  **Ferment**:
    *   Seal the fermenter and attach an airlock.
    *   Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature, ideally around **18-20°C (64-68°F)** for US-05.
    *   Primary fermentation will typically last 5-10 days. Look for signs of active fermentation (bubbling airlock, krausen formation) and then for it to subside.
3.  **Monitor Gravity**: After primary fermentation appears complete, check the specific gravity. It should be stable for 2-3 consecutive days and close to the target final gravity (FG) of 1.012.

## VII. (Optional) Conditioning / Bottling / Kegging

1.  **Cold Crash (Optional)**: Once fermentation is complete, you can cold crash the beer (lower temperature to near freezing for a few days) to help yeast and other particulates settle out for a clearer beer.
2.  **Packaging**:
    *   **Bottling**: If bottling, calculate the appropriate amount of priming sugar, dissolve it in a small amount of boiled water, and gently mix it into the beer before bottling.
    *   **Kegging**: If kegging, transfer the beer to a sanitized keg and carbonate to your desired level (e.g., 2.2-2.5 volumes of CO2).
3.  **Condition/Carbonate**:
    *   Bottled beer: Store at room temperature for 2-3 weeks to carbonate.
    *   Kegged beer: Can be force carbonated more quickly.
4.  **Enjoy**: Once carbonated and conditioned, chill your Classic Amber Ale and enjoy responsibly!
