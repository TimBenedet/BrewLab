## 🌾 Mashing

*   **Grain Preparation**: Ensure all grains, especially roasted malts, are well-crushed.
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 18 liters of brewing water to 72°C (162°F).
*   **Mash In**: Add crushed grains, stirring to avoid clumps. Aim for a mash temperature of 68°C (154°F) for a fuller body.
*   **Saccharification Rest**: Hold mash at 68°C (154°F) for 75 minutes.
*   **Mash Out**: Raise temperature to 77°C (170°F) and hold for 10 minutes.
*   **Lauter & Sparge**: Recirculate, then lauter. Sparge with water at 77°C (170°F) to collect approximately 25 liters of wort.

## 🔥 Boil (75 minutes total)

*   **Bring to Boil**: Achieve a rolling boil.
*   **75 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 30g of Warrior hops (Bittering).
*   **30 min**: Add 1 tsp Irish Moss or 1 Whirlfloc tablet.
*   **10 min**: Add 15g of Willamette hops (Aroma/Flavor).

## 🌪️ Whirlpool/Aroma Additions

*   **Flameout**: Turn off heat.
*   **Coffee Addition**: Add 50g of coarsely ground dark roast coffee beans (in a sanitized muslin bag) OR 200ml of cold brew coffee concentrate.
*   **Whirlpool**: Stir gently for 10 minutes, then let settle for 20 minutes. The goal is to extract coffee aroma without excessive bitterness.

## 🥶 Cooling

*   **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to 18-20°C (64-68°F). Ensure everything from this point is sanitized.

---
## 🧪 Fermentation

*   **Transfer & Aerate**: Transfer cooled wort to a sanitized fermenter, aerating well.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Pitch a robust ale yeast strain suitable for stouts (e.g., SafAle S-04 or a liquid Irish Ale yeast).
*   **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 19°C (66°F) for 10-14 days, or until FG is stable.
*   **Secondary (Optional Coffee Boost)**: After primary fermentation, you can rack to a secondary fermenter and add another small dose of cold brew concentrate or whole coffee beans for a few days if a stronger coffee profile is desired. Monitor carefully.

## 🍾 Bottling/Kegging

*   **Check Final Gravity**: Ensure fermentation is complete.
*   **Priming/Carbonation**:
    *   **Bottles**: Use slightly less priming sugar than for lighter ales (e.g., ~80-90g dextrose for 19L) for a creamier mouthfeel.
    *   **Keg**: Carbonate to around 2.0-2.2 volumes of CO2.
*   **Condition**: Allow 2-4 weeks for flavors to meld and mature.
*   **Serve**: Best served not too cold (e.g., 10-13°C or 50-55°F) to appreciate the complex flavors. Enjoy your rich Coffee Stout! ☕🍺

Happy Brewing!
