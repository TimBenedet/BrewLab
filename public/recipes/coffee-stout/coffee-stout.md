## Brewer's Notes
A rich and roasty stout infused with cold brew coffee for an extra kick. Perfect for colder evenings. The key is a good quality coffee and a balanced malt bill.

## Mashing
*   **Grain Preparation**: Mill your grains. Darker grains like Roasted Barley can be milled finer.
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 18 liters (4.75 gal) of brewing water to 72°C (161.6°F).
*   **Mash In**: Combine grains with strike water. Aim for a mash temperature of 68°C (154.4°F). This higher temperature promotes a fuller body. Stir well.
*   **Rest**: Maintain mash temperature at 68°C (154.4°F) for 75 minutes.
*   **Mash Out**: Raise temperature to 77°C (170.6°F) and hold for 10 minutes.

## Boil
*   **Lauter & Sparge**: Collect wort by lautering. Sparge with 10 liters (2.6 gal) of water at 77°C (170.6°F), or until pre-boil volume of approx. 24 liters (6.3 gal) is reached.
*   **Boil Duration**: Total boil time is 75 minutes.
*   **75 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 30g of East Kent Goldings hops (bittering).
*   **15 min (Remaining)**: Add 15g of Fuggles hops (flavor/aroma) and 1 tsp Irish Moss.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
*   **Flameout**: At the end of the boil, turn off the heat.
*   **No Whirlpool Hops**: For this recipe, we rely on the coffee for the dominant aroma post-fermentation. A short whirlpool of 10 minutes can help settle trub.

## Cooling
*   **Cool Wort**: Cool the wort rapidly to 18°C (64.4°F). Use your preferred chilling method (immersion chiller, plate chiller, etc.).

## Fermentation
*   **Sanitize**: Ensure all fermentation equipment is meticulously sanitized.
*   **Transfer & Aerate**: Transfer wort to the fermenter. Aerate thoroughly by shaking or using an oxygenation system.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Pitch 1 sachet of SafAle S-04 yeast (or a similar English Ale yeast).
*   **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 19°C (66.2°F) for 7 days.
*   **Coffee Addition**: After 7 days (or when primary fermentation subsides), prepare 250ml (approx. 1 cup) of strong, good quality cold brew coffee. Add it directly to the fermenter. Avoid adding hot coffee.
*   **Secondary/Conditioning**: Let the beer condition on the coffee for another 3-5 days.

## Bottling/Kegging
*   **Check FG**: Confirm final gravity is stable.
*   **Prime (Bottling)**: If bottling, use ~70-80g of dextrose for a 19L batch for a moderate carbonation suitable for stouts.
*   **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer gently, avoiding oxidation.
*   **Condition**:
    *   **Bottles**: Condition at room temperature for at least 3 weeks. Stouts benefit from longer conditioning.
    *   **Keg**: Force carbonate.
*   **Serve**: Chill and serve. Best enjoyed at around 8-12°C (46-54°F) to appreciate the full flavor profile. Enjoy your Coffee Stout! ☕️🍺
