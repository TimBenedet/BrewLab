# Coffee Stout - Brewing Steps ☕🖤

## I. Mash & Preparation 🌾

1.  **Mill Grains**: Mill your specialty dark grains (Chocolate Malt, Roasted Barley) separately or with a wider mill gap if possible to reduce husk shredding.
2.  **Heat Strike Water**: Heat 20 liters of water to 73°C (163°F).
3.  **Mash In**: Combine crushed base malts and specialty grains with hot water. Aim for a mash temperature of 68°C (154°F).
4.  **Mash Rest**: Maintain mash at 68°C (154°F) for 60-75 minutes.
5.  **Mash Out & Sparge**: Raise to 76°C (169°F) for 10 minutes. Sparge with 10 liters of 76°C water.

## II. Boil & Hop Additions 🌿⏱️

1.  **Collect & Boil**: Collect wort and bring to a vigorous boil. Total boil time: 75 minutes.
2.  **75 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 30g of Magnum hops (or similar high alpha bittering hop).
3.  **15 min (Remaining)**: Add 1 tsp Irish Moss.
4.  **Flameout / Whirlpool**:
    *   Cool slightly to around 85-90°C (185-194°F).
    *   Add 30g of Willamette hops (or similar aroma hop).
    *   Add 50-100g of coarsely ground dark roast coffee beans (or cold brew concentrate equivalent to taste during fermentation). Steep for 15-20 minutes.

## III. Cooling & Transfer ❄️➡️

1.  **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to ale fermentation temperature, around 19°C (66°F).
2.  **Transfer**: Transfer to a sanitized fermenter, avoiding excessive trub.
3.  **Aerate**: Oxygenate the wort thoroughly.

## IV. Fermentation 酵母✨

1.  **Pitch Yeast**: Pitch a healthy starter of your chosen ale yeast (e.g., a clean American Ale yeast or an Irish Ale yeast).
2.  **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F).
    *   If adding coffee post-fermentation (e.g., cold brew concentrate or "dry beaning" with whole beans), do so after primary fermentation slows, typically 5-7 days. Taste regularly.
3.  **Conditioning**: Allow to condition for at least 2 weeks after fermentation is complete. Longer conditioning can meld flavors.

## V. Packaging & Carbonation 🍾📦

1.  **Taste & Adjust**: Before packaging, taste. If more coffee aroma/flavor is desired, consider a short "dry bean" addition (1-2 days with whole beans in a sanitized mesh bag).
2.  **Package**: Bottle or keg as desired.
3.  **Carbonate**: Aim for a moderate carbonation level (e.g., 2.0-2.4 vols CO2).

## VI. Serve & Savor ☕🍺

Serve slightly warmer than typical ales, around 10-13°C (50-55°F), to fully appreciate the coffee and malt notes. Enjoy your rich Coffee Stout!
