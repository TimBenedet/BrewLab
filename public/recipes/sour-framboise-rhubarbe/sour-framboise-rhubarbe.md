## Brewer's Notes

This recipe creates a tart and refreshing sour ale with prominent raspberry and rhubarb notes. The key is a clean kettle souring process followed by a generous fruit addition. Adjust fruit quantities to your preference.

## Mashing

*   **Prepare Mash Tun**: Preheat your mash tun with hot water.
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 12 liters of water to 72°C (161.6°F).
*   **Mash In**: Add grains (Pilsner, Wheat, Acidulated). Stir well. Target mash temperature: 66°C (150.8°F).
*   **Rest**: Hold mash at 66°C (150.8°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out**: Raise temperature to 76°C (168.8°F) and hold for 10 minutes.

## Kettle Souring (Pre-Boil)

*   **Collect Wort**: Sparge grains to collect about 23 liters of wort in your boil kettle.
*   **Cool Wort**: Cool the wort to 35-38°C (95-100°F).
*   **Pre-acidify (Optional)**: Adjust pH to ~4.5 with lactic acid to inhibit unwanted bacteria.
*   **Pitch Lactobacillus**: Add Lactobacillus culture (e.g., GoodBelly shot, pure culture).
*   **Sour**: Hold temperature at 35-38°C (95-100°F) for 24-48 hours, or until desired tartness is reached (target pH ~3.2-3.5). Purge headspace with CO2 if possible to prevent oxygen exposure.

## Boil

*   **Bring to Boil**: Once desired sourness is achieved, bring the wort to a rolling boil to kill the Lactobacillus. This will take at least 15 minutes of boiling. Total boil time is 60 minutes from this point.
*   **60 min - Bittering Hops**: Add 10g of Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops. (This is mainly for stability, not bitterness).

## Whirlpool/Aroma Additions

*   No hop additions here to keep the focus on fruit and sourness.

---

## Cooling

*   **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to yeast pitching temperature (around 18-20°C or 64-68°F).

---

## Fermentation

*   **Sanitize**: Ensure your fermenter and all equipment are thoroughly sanitized.
*   **Transfer Wort**: Transfer the cooled wort to the fermenter.
*   **Aerate Wort**: Aerate the wort well.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Add 1 sachet of SafAle US-05 yeast (or a neutral ale yeast).
*   **Primary Ferment**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until final gravity is stable and near target.
*   **Add Fruit**: After primary fermentation subsides, rack beer onto 1kg of raspberries (frozen then thawed is good) and 0.75kg of chopped rhubarb in a sanitized secondary fermenter or add directly to primary. Ensure fruit is submerged.
*   **Secondary Ferment**: Allow to ferment on fruit for 7-10 days. Agitate gently if fruit cap forms.

## Bottling/Kegging

*   **Check Final Gravity**: Ensure fermentation is complete.
*   **Prime (if bottling)**: Prepare priming sugar solution. Given the fruit, carbonation might be slightly more active; aim for around 2.2-2.5 volumes of CO2.
*   **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer beer carefully, avoiding splashing and leaving fruit sediment behind.
*   **Condition**:
    *   Bottles: Store at room temperature for 2-3 weeks.
    *   Keg: Force carbonate.
*   **Chill & Enjoy**: Serve cold and enjoy your vibrant Sour Framboise Rhubarbe! 🍹
