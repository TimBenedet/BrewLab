## Brewer's Notes
This Session IPA is designed to be hop-forward and aromatic, but with a lower ABV, making it perfect for enjoying a few. Focus on late hop additions for maximum aroma and flavor with restrained bitterness.

## Mashing
*   **Water Profile**: Adjust brewing water to enhance hop character (e.g., higher sulfate to chloride ratio).
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 16 liters (4.2 gal) of water to 70°C (158°F).
*   **Mash In**: Dough in with pale malts and oats. Target a mash temperature of 66°C (150.8°F) for a fermentable wort.
*   **Rest**: Hold at 66°C (150.8°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out**: Increase to 76°C (168.8°F) for 10 minutes.

## Boil
*   **Collect Wort**: Lauter and sparge to collect approximately 22 liters (5.8 gal) of wort.
*   **Boil Duration**: 60 minutes.
*   **60 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 10g of Citra hops (for initial bittering foundation).
*   **10 min (Remaining)**: Add 20g of Mosaic hops and 1 Whirlfloc tablet.
*   **5 min (Remaining)**: Add 20g of Galaxy hops.

## Whirlpool / Aroma Additions
*   **Flameout**: Turn off heat.
*   **Cool to Whirlpool Temp**: Allow wort to cool to 82°C (180°F).
*   **Whirlpool Hops**: Add 30g of Citra hops and 30g of Mosaic hops.
*   **Whirlpool Duration**: Stir/whirlpool for 20 minutes, then let settle for another 10 minutes.

## Cooling
*   **Rapid Cooling**: Cool the wort quickly to 19°C (66.2°F). Efficient cooling is crucial for clarity and to minimize DMS.

## Fermentation
*   **Sanitize**: Rigorous sanitation of fermenter and transfer equipment is key.
*   **Transfer & Aerate**: Transfer cooled wort to the fermenter. Aerate well.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Pitch 1 sachet of a clean American Ale yeast like SafAle US-05 or a liquid equivalent.
*   **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 19-20°C (66-68°F) for about 5-7 days, or until activity significantly slows.
*   **Dry Hop - First Addition**: After primary fermentation, add 40g of Galaxy hops and 30g of Citra hops directly to the fermenter.
*   **Dry Hop - Duration 1**: Allow 3 days for the first dry hop addition.
*   **Dry Hop - Second Addition (Optional Biotransformation)**: Some brewers add a second smaller dry hop charge (e.g., 20g Mosaic) during active fermentation (day 2-3) for biotransformation effects. For this recipe, we'll stick to a post-primary dry hop.

## Bottling/Kegging
*   **FG Check**: Ensure fermentation is complete and FG is stable.
*   **Cold Crash (Optional)**: Cold crash the beer at 0-2°C (32-35°F) for 24-48 hours to improve clarity and drop out yeast/hops.
*   **Transfer**: Gently transfer the beer to a bottling bucket or keg, being careful to leave yeast and hop sediment behind. Avoid splashing.
*   **Prime (Bottling)**: If bottling, use ~90g of dextrose for a 19L batch for a lively IPA carbonation.
*   **Bottle/Keg**: Package the beer.
*   **Condition & Carbonate**:
    *   **Bottles**: Condition at room temperature for 1-2 weeks.
    *   **Keg**: Force carbonate to desired level (e.g., 2.4-2.6 vols CO2).
*   **Serve Fresh**: IPAs, especially session IPAs, are best enjoyed fresh to savor the hop aromas. Chill and enjoy your hoppy Session IPA! 🌿🍺
