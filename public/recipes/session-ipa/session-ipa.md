# Session IPA - Brewing Steps 🍊🍋🌲

## I. Mash & Preparation 🌾

1.  **Water Profile**: Adjust brewing water for a balanced to slightly sulfate-forward profile to accentuate hop bitterness and aroma.
2.  **Heat Strike Water**: Heat 18 liters of water to 70°C (158°F).
3.  **Mash In**: Combine crushed grains with hot water. Aim for a lower mash temperature, around 65-66°C (149-151°F), for a more fermentable wort and a drier finish.
4.  **Mash Rest**: Maintain mash temperature for 60 minutes.
5.  **Mash Out & Sparge**: Raise to 76°C (169°F) for 10 minutes. Sparge with 10 liters of 76°C water to collect your target pre-boil volume.

## II. Boil & Hop Additions (Focus on Late Hops!) 🌿⏱️

1.  **Collect & Boil**: Bring wort to a rolling boil. Total boil time: 60 minutes.
2.  **60 min (Start of Boil)**: Add a small bittering charge, e.g., 10g of a clean bittering hop like Magnum or Warrior. The goal is moderate bitterness, not overwhelming.
3.  **10 min (Remaining)**: Add 20g of Citra hops and 20g of Mosaic hops (or similar citrus/tropical aroma hops). Add 1 tsp Irish Moss.
4.  **Flameout / Whirlpool (The Main Event!)**:
    *   Turn off heat.
    *   Cool wort to 80-85°C (176-185°F).
    *   Add a large aroma/flavor charge: 30g Citra, 30g Mosaic, 20g Simcoe (or your favorite combo).
    *   Steep/Whirlpool for 20-30 minutes.

## III. Cooling & Transfer ❄️➡️

1.  **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to yeast pitching temperature, around 18-20°C (64-68°F).
2.  **Transfer**: Carefully transfer to a sanitized fermenter, minimizing hot-side aeration.
3.  **Aerate**: Oxygenate the wort well.

## IV. Fermentation & Dry Hopping 酵母🌿✨

1.  **Pitch Yeast**: Pitch a clean, well-attenuating ale yeast (e.g., US-05, WLP001, WY1056).
2.  **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F).
3.  **Dry Hop**: Add dry hops 3-5 days into fermentation (during active fermentation, or "biotransformation" dry hop) OR after primary fermentation is complete.
    *   Typical Dry Hop Charge: 30g Citra, 30g Mosaic, 20g Amarillo (or other favorites).
    *   Duration: 3-5 days. Avoid extended contact to prevent grassy flavors.

## V. Packaging & Carbonation 🍾📦

1.  **Cold Crash (Recommended)**: After dry hopping, cold crash to 0-4°C (32-39°F) for 48 hours to settle hops and yeast.
2.  **Package**: Carefully transfer to sanitized bottles or keg, avoiding oxygen pickup (crucial for IPAs!).
3.  **Carbonate**: Aim for a moderate to high carbonation level (e.g., 2.4-2.6 vols CO2).

## VI. Drink Fresh! 🌟

Session IPAs are best enjoyed fresh to preserve their vibrant hop aromas. Cheers!
