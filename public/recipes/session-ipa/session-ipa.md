# Easy Going Session IPA - Recipe Steps

## 🌾 Mashing
1.  **Equipment Prep**: Clean and preheat your mash tun.
2.  **Strike Water**: Heat 14 liters of water to 72°C (162°F).
3.  **Mash In**: Mix grains with strike water. Aim for a mash temperature of 66°C (151°F). Ensure no dough balls.
4.  **Rest**: Hold mash at 66°C (151°F) for 60 minutes.
5.  **Mash Out**: Raise temperature to 76°C (168°F) and hold for 10 minutes.

## 🔥 Boil (60 minutes total)
1.  **Collect Wort**: Sparge with approximately 11 liters of 76°C (168°F) water, targeting a pre-boil volume of around 22 liters.
2.  **Bring to Boil**: Get a good rolling boil.
3.  **60 min - Bittering Hops**: Add 10g of Simcoe hops.
4.  **15 min - Flavor Hops**: Add 15g of Citra hops and 15g of Mosaic hops.
5.  **5 min - More Flavor/Aroma**: Add 10g of Galaxy hops.
6.  **0 min/Flameout - Aroma Hops**: Add 20g of Citra hops and 20g of Mosaic hops.

## 🌪️ Whirlpool (Highly Recommended for IPAs)
1.  **Cool Slightly**: If desired, cool wort to around 82-88°C (180-190°F) before whirlpooling flameout hops.
2.  **Whirlpool Hops**: Add flameout hops and stir/whirlpool for 20 minutes.

## 🥶 Cooling
1.  **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool the wort to 18-20°C (64-68°F) for yeast pitching.

---

## 🧪 Fermentation
1.  **Sanitize Fermenter**: Ensure everything the cooled wort touches is sanitized.
2.  **Transfer & Aerate**: Transfer wort to the fermenter and aerate well.
3.  **Pitch Yeast**: Add 1 sachet of Fermentis SafAle US-05 or similar clean American ale yeast.
4.  **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment at 18-20°C (64-68°F) for 7-10 days, or until final gravity is stable.

---

## 🌱 Dry Hopping (Essential for modern IPAs!)
1.  **Timing**: Add dry hops 3-4 days before packaging, or when active fermentation slows (around day 5-7).
2.  **Hops**: Add 30g of Citra hops and 30g of Galaxy hops directly to the fermenter.
3.  **Contact Time**: Allow 3-4 days of contact time for dry hops. Avoid excessive oxygen exposure.

## 🍾 Bottling/Kegging
1.  **Final Gravity Check**: Make sure fermentation is complete.
2.  **Prime (if bottling)**: Use about 100-110g of dextrose for a 19L batch for moderate-high carbonation typical of IPAs.
3.  **Bottle/Keg**: Transfer gently.
4.  **Condition**:
    *   Bottles: 1-2 weeks at room temperature. IPAs are best fresh, so don't age too long.
    *   Keg: Carbonate to 2.4-2.6 vols CO2.
5.  **Enjoy Fresh**: Drink your Session IPA fresh to enjoy the hop aromas! 🌿🍺

Happy brewing this sessionable delight!
