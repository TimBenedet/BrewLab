## 📝 Brewer's Notes - Session IPA

A highly aromatic and flavorful IPA with a lower alcohol content, making it perfect for longer sessions. Expect a burst of citrus, tropical, or piney hop notes with a clean, crisp finish.

## 🌾 Mashing

*   **Water Chemistry**: Adjust brewing water to enhance hop character (e.g., higher sulfate-to-chloride ratio).
*   **Strike Water**: Heat 14 liters of water to 70°C (158°F).
*   **Mash In**: Add grains, targeting a mash temperature of 65°C (149°F) for a highly fermentable wort and a drier finish.
*   **Saccharification Rest**: Hold at 65°C (149°F) for 60 minutes.
*   **Mash Out**: Raise to 76°C (168°F) for 10 minutes.
*   **Lauter & Sparge**: Sparge with water at 76°C (168°F) to collect about 22-23 liters of wort.

## 🔥 Boil (60 minutes total)

*   **Bring to Boil**: Vigorous boil.
*   **60 min (Start of Boil)**: Add 10g of Centennial hops (Bittering - keep it light).
*   **10 min**: Add 20g of Citra hops and 1 Whirlfloc tablet.
*   **5 min**: Add 20g of Mosaic hops.

## 🌪️ Whirlpool/Aroma Additions

*   **Flameout**: Turn off heat.
*   **Whirlpool Hops**: Add a generous charge: 30g of Galaxy hops and 30g of Simcoe hops.
*   **Whirlpool Duration**: Cool wort to around 80-85°C (176-185°F) if possible before adding whirlpool hops to preserve volatile oils. Whirlpool for 20 minutes, then let settle for 20 minutes.

## 🥶 Cooling

*   **Cool Wort**: Rapidly cool to 18-20°C (64-68°F). Sanitize everything post-boil.

---
## 🧪 Fermentation

*   **Transfer & Aerate**: Transfer to fermenter, aerating thoroughly.
*   **Pitch Yeast**: Use a clean, highly attenuative American ale yeast (e.g., SafAle US-05 or a liquid Chico strain).
*   **Primary Fermentation**: Ferment cool, around 18-19°C (64-66°F) for 7-10 days.
*   **Dry Hopping**: After primary fermentation slows (around day 4-5), add a significant dry hop charge. For example: 40g Citra and 40g Mosaic.
*   **Dry Hop Duration**: Let dry hops steep for 3-5 days. Avoid prolonged contact to prevent grassy flavors.

---
## 🍾 Bottling/Kegging

*   **Check Final Gravity**: Ensure fermentation and dry hopping are complete.
*   **Cold Crash (Recommended)**: Cold crash for 24-48 hours to help hops and yeast settle out for a clearer beer.
*   **Priming/Carbonation**:
    *   **Bottles**: Prime for a moderate to high carbonation level (e.g., ~110-125g dextrose for 19L) to enhance aroma.
    *   **Keg**: Carbonate to 2.4-2.6 volumes of CO2.
*   **Serve Fresh**: IPAs, especially session IPAs, are best enjoyed fresh to capture peak hop aroma. Chill and serve! 🌲🍊🍺

Happy Brewing!
